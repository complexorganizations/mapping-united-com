# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains the workflow definitions for the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) of our project using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Workflows

Here's a summary of the workflows available in this directory:

### 1. Build and Test

- **File:** [build-test.yml](./build-test.yml)
- **Purpose:** This workflow is triggered on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It ensures that the code builds successfully and passes all tests.

### 2. Deploy to Production

- **File:** [deploy.yml](./deploy.yml)
- **Purpose:** This workflow is triggered manually and deploys the latest changes to the production environment.

### 3. Another Workflow (replace with the actual name)

- **File:** [another-workflow.yml](./another-workflow.yml)
- **Purpose:** Description of what this workflow does.

## Usage

To trigger a workflow manually, go to the `Actions` tab in the GitHub repository, select the desired workflow, and click the `Run workflow` button.

For workflows triggered automatically, you can monitor their status in the `Actions` tab after making a push or creating a pull request.
