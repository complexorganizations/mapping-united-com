# Installation Guide for Flutter Application

Welcome to the installation guide for our Flutter application. Follow the steps below to get the app up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Dart SDK**: Flutter requires the Dart language, which comes bundled with the Flutter SDK installation.

3. **Android Studio or VS Code**: You can use either of these IDEs for Flutter development. Make sure to install the Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions for the respective IDE.

4. **Emulator or Physical Device**: You can use an emulator for Android/iOS or a physical device for testing.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/complexorganizations/parking-united-com.git
cd parking-united-com/parking_united/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command fetches all the required Dart packages for the project.

### 3. Set Up an Emulator

If you're using **Android Studio**:

- Open AVD Manager.
- Create a new virtual device or use an existing one.
- Start the emulator.

If you're using **VS Code**:

- Ensure you have the Android Emulator extension installed.
- Start the emulator using the command palette.

### 4. Run the Application

In the project directory, execute:

```bash
flutter run
```

This command builds and launches the app on the emulator or connected physical device.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Flutter command not found.

  - **Solution**: Ensure Flutter's installation path is added to your system's PATH.

- **Issue**: App not launching on the emulator.

  - **Solution**: Ensure the emulator is running and detected by Flutter. Use `flutter devices` to check connected devices.

- **Issue**: Dart packages not installing.
  - **Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure the `pubspec.yaml` file is correctly formatted.

## Conclusion

You should now have the Flutter application running on your local machine. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) or raise an issue in this repository.
