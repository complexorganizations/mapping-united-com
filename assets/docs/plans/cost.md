2. **Labor Costs:**

   - Assuming two drone pilots working for 8 hours each at $30 per hour:
     - Total Labor Cost for Two Pilots for One Day: 2 pilots _ 8 hours _ $30/hour = $480

1. **Drone Costs:**

   - Assuming each drone costs $5,000, and you have two drones:
     - Total Drone Cost: 2 drones \* $5,000 = $10,000

1. **Maintenance and Repairs:**

   - Budgeting 10% of the drone cost for maintenance and repairs:
     - Maintenance and Repairs: 10% of $10,000 = $1000 per year

1. **Software and App Development:**

   - App development costs can vary widely, but let's assume a one-time development cost of $20,000.

1. **Data Storage and Processing:**

   - Costs for cloud storage and processing can vary based on usage. Assuming $500 per month:
     - Total Data Storage and Processing for One Day: $500/30 days = $16.67

1. **Insurance:**

   - Assuming an annual insurance cost of $10,000, for a daily estimate:
     - Daily Insurance Cost: $10,000/365 days = $27.40 per day

1. **Miscellaneous Costs:**
   - Miscellaneous costs like office space, marketing, and legal fees can vary greatly. Let's assume an additional $1,000 for one day.

Adding up these estimated costs for one day:

- Labor: $480
- Drones: $10,000
- Maintenance and Repairs: $500/365 (daily estimate) = $1.37
- Software and App Development: $20,000/365 (daily estimate) = $54.79
- Data Storage and Processing: $16.67
- Insurance: $27.40
- Miscellaneous Costs: $1,000

Total Estimated Cost: $10,580.23

Total Estimated Daily Cost: $1000.00

Please keep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual costs can vary based on location, specific drone models, insurance rates, and other factors. It's crucial to conduct a detailed financial analysis and consult with experts in the field for a more accurate cost breakdown tailored to your specific business plan.
