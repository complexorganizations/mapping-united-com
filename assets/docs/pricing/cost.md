1. **Labor Costs:**

   - Assuming two drone pilots working for 8 hours each at $30 per hour:
     - Total Labor Cost for Two Pilots for One Day: 2 pilots * 8 hours * $30/hour = $480

2. **Drone Costs:**

   - Assuming each drone costs $5,000, and you have two drones:
     - Total Drone Cost: 2 drones * $5,000 = $10,000

3. **Maintenance and Repairs:**

   - Budgeting 10% of the drone cost for maintenance and repairs:
     - Maintenance and Repairs: 10% of $10,000 = $1,000 per year

4. **Software and App Development:**

   - App development costs can vary widely, but let's assume a one-time development cost of $20,000.

5. **Data Storage and Processing:**

   - Costs for cloud storage and processing can vary based on usage. Assuming $500 per month:
     - Total Data Storage and Processing for One Day: $500/30 days = $16.67

6. **Insurance:**

   - Assuming an annual insurance cost of $10,000, for a daily estimate:
     - Daily Insurance Cost: $10,000/365 days = $27.40 per day

7. **Miscellaneous Costs:**
   - Miscellaneous costs like office space, marketing, and legal fees can vary greatly. Let's assume an additional $1,000 for one day.

Adding up these corrected estimated costs for one day:

- Labor: $480
- Drones: $10,000
- Maintenance and Repairs: $1,000/365 (daily estimate) = $2.74
- Software and App Development: $20,000/365 (daily estimate) = $54.79
- Data Storage and Processing: $16.67
- Insurance: $27.40
- Miscellaneous Costs: $1,000

Total Estimated Cost: $10,581.60

Total Estimated Daily Cost: $1,139.60

Again, please keep in mind that these are rough estimates, and actual costs can vary based on various factors. It's essential to conduct a detailed financial analysis tailored to your specific business plan and consult with experts in the field for a more accurate cost breakdown.
