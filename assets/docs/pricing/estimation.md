1. **Labor Costs:**

   - Assuming two drone pilots working for 8 hours each at $30 per hour:
     - Total Labor Cost for Two Pilots for One Day: 2 pilots _ 8 hours _ $30/hour = $480

2. **Drone Costs:**

   - Assuming you purchase two drones at a one-time cost:
     - Total Drone Cost: 2 drones \* $5,000 = $10,000 (one-time cost)

3. **Maintenance and Repairs:**

   - Budgeting 10% of the drone cost for maintenance and repairs annually:
     - Maintenance and Repairs: 10% of $10,000 = $1,000 per year

4. **Software and App Development:**

   - Assuming a one-time development cost of $20,000.

5. **Data Storage and Processing:**

   - Costs for cloud storage and processing can vary based on usage. Assuming $500 per month:
     - Total Data Storage and Processing for One Year: $500/month \* 12 months = $6,000 per year

6. **Insurance:**

   - Assuming an annual insurance cost of $10,000.

7. **Miscellaneous Costs:**

   - Miscellaneous costs like office space, marketing, and legal fees can vary greatly. Let's assume an additional $10,000 for one year.

8. **Application Maintenance and Updates:**

   - Assuming an annual cost of 20% of the initial development cost:
     - Annual Maintenance and Updates Cost: 20% of $20,000 = $4,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the total annual costs:

- Annual Labor Cost: $480/day \* 365 days = $175,200
- Annual Maintenance and Repairs Cost: $1,000
- Annual Software and App Development Cost: $20,000
- Annual Data Storage and Processing Cost: $6,000
- Annual Insurance Cost: $10,000
- Annual Miscellaneous Costs: $10,000
- Annual Application Maintenance and Updates Cost: $4,000

Total Estimated Annual Cost =
$175,200 + $1,000 + $20,000 + $6,000 + $10,000 + $10,000 + $4,000

Total Estimated Annual Cost = $226,200

So, in a more realistic real-world scenario, the estimated overall cost to keep this drone business running for one year is approximately $226,200, excluding the one-time drone purchase cost. Please keep in mind that these are still rough estimates and actual costs may vary based on specific circumstances and business needs. It's essential to conduct detailed financial planning for your unique situation.
